"Treasure Hunter" is a Java Swing-based game that utilizes the 
A* algorithm to find the shortest path. 
The player searches for treasures such as
gold, emerald, silver, and copper, which are randomly placed on the grid. The game features both moving and stationary obstacles. Moving obstacles include birds and bees, which follow a predefined path. Stationary obstacles, such as trees, mountains, walls, and rocks, have fixed sizes and block the player's way. The objective is to navigate through the grid using the shortest path algorithm to collect all 
treasures while avoiding obstacles.
